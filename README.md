# Assembly Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of exercises completed as part of the Computer Architecture course at the Technical University of Moldova. These exercises focus on fundamental concepts of assembly language programming.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises are organized into separate folders, each corresponding to a specific task:

1. **Exercise 6.2.1.2**: Exploring the possibility of having multiple code and data segments in a program.
2. **Exercise 6.2.1.5**: Writing a program with two instructions to add a value to registers and analyzing the generated machine code.
3. **Exercise 6.2.1.11**: Declaring a null-terminated string variable containing the name of a favorite color.
4. **Exercise 6.2.1.14**: Declaring and initializing an array of 20 unsigned bytes.
5. **Exercise 6.2.2.1**: Calculating an arithmetic expression using registers.
6. **Exercise 6.2.2.2**: Modifying a program to use 64-bit variables and resolving syntax errors.
7. **Exercise 6.2.3.1**: Defining symbolic constants for the days of the week and creating an array using these constants.
8. **Exercise 6.2.3.3**: Defining symbolic names for string literals and using them in variable definitions.

## Structure

Each exercise is contained in its own folder with the following structure:

- `main.asm`: The assembly source code for the exercise.
- `.vcxproj` and `.filters` files: Visual Studio project configuration files.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio with MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler).
