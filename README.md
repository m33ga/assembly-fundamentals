# Assembly Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of exercises completed as part of the Computer Architecture course at the Technical University of Moldova. These exercises focus on fundamental concepts of assembly language programming.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises are organized into separate folders, each corresponding to a specific task:

1. **[Exercise 6.2.1.2](exercises/exercise-6.2.1.2/main.asm)**: Exploring the possibility of having multiple code and data segments in a program.
2. **[Exercise 6.2.1.5](exercises/exercise-6.2.1.5/main.asm)**: Writing a program with two instructions to add a value to registers and analyzing the generated machine code.
3. **[Exercise 6.2.1.11](exercises/exercise-6.2.1.11/main.asm)**: Declaring a null-terminated string variable containing the name of a favorite color.
4. **[Exercise 6.2.1.14](exercises/exercise-6.2.1.14/main.asm)**: Declaring and initializing an array of 20 unsigned bytes.
5. **[Exercise 6.2.2.1](exercises/exercise-6.2.2.1/main.asm)**: Calculating an arithmetic expression using registers.
6. **[Exercise 6.2.2.2](exercises/exercise-6.2.2.2/main.asm)**: Modifying a program to use 64-bit variables and resolving syntax errors.
7. **[Exercise 6.2.3.1](exercises/exercise-6.2.3.1/main.asm)**: Defining symbolic constants for the days of the week and creating an array using these constants.
8. **[Exercise 6.2.3.3](exercises/exercise-6.2.3.3/main.asm)**: Defining symbolic names for string literals and using them in variable definitions.

## Structure

Each exercise is contained in its own folder with the following structure:

- `main.asm`: The assembly source code for the exercise.
- `.vcxproj` and `.filters` files: Visual Studio project configuration files.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio with MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler).
